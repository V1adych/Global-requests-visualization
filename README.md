## How to use
**Make sure you have ports `3000`, `5000`, `8000` available** \
To launch, simply type:

```bash
docker compuse up -d
```

This will start building containers in detached mode. Once they are done, you can access the application at [`http://localhost:5000`](http://localhost:5000) 

## How to stop
To stop the application, run:

```bash
docker compose down
```

## Acknowledgements
